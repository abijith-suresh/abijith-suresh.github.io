# Portfolio

> My personal corner of the internet where I share thoughts and experiences in writing, not in short clips or fast feeds.

[Live Site](https://abijith-suresh.github.io)

## Why This Exists

I chose a blog format because I value putting ideas into full sentences. In a world of reels, stories, and rapid scroll, writing lets me slow down and explore things more fully.

I built this site as a home for my thinking. It is where I collect:

- Reflections from my work and life
- Things I am learning
- Notes that help me understand better
- Occasional technical posts

I am not on video or social media much. Writing helps me articulate things clearly, and this felt like the right format.

## What You Will Find Here

This site is lightly opinionated and intentionally simple. Some content will be polished; other posts may be drafts or personal notes. All of it is here because it helped me think, and I hope it helps readers too.

## Running Locally

bun install
bun run dev

## DevContainer Support

This project includes a devcontainer configuration for consistent development environments. Works with both Docker and Podman.

**Using Docker:**

**Using Podman:**

1. Install [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)
2. Configure VSCode to use Podman: `"dev.containers.dockerPath": "podman"`
3. Open project in VSCode and click "Reopen in Container"

## Inspiration

This site draws inspiration from a few projects whose creators I admire:

- [steipete.me](https://steipete.me) — a clear example of a personal blog focused on substance and openness
- [astro-erudite](https://astro-erudite.vercel.app/) template
- [merox-erudite](https://merox-erudite.vercel.app/) template

Their simplicity and thoughtfulness shaped how I approached mine.
