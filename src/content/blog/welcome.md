Welcome to my portfolio and blog! This is where I share my projects, technical writings, and thoughts on software development.

## What You'll Find Here

This website serves as a central hub for:

- **Projects**: Detailed case studies of my work, including technical challenges and solutions
- **Blog Posts**: Technical articles, tutorials, and reflections on software development
- **About**: Information about my background, skills, and experience

## The Tech Stack

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), a modern static site generator that prioritizes performance and developer experience. Some key features:

- **Content Collections**: Type-safe content management with Zod validation
- **Fast by Default**: Minimal JavaScript, maximum performance
- **Markdown Support**: Write content in plain Markdown or MDX

## Design Philosophy

I believe in clean, minimal design that puts content first. This site follows the principles of:

1. **Simplicity**: Remove what isn't necessary
2. **Readability**: Make text easy to read and scan
3. **Performance**: Fast load times on all devices
4. **Accessibility**: Usable by everyone, regardless of ability

## What's Next

I'll be regularly updating this blog with technical content, project updates, and insights from my development journey. Stay tuned!
