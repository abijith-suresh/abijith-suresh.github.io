import Callout from "@/components/mdx/Callout.astro";

This is a test post to demonstrate MDX components in action.

## Callout Components

Here are the different callout variants available:

<Callout variant="note">
  This is a **note** callout. Use it for general information that you want to highlight.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="tip">
  This is a **tip** callout. Use it for helpful suggestions and best practices.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="warning">
  This is a **warning** callout. Use it for important cautions that users should be aware of.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="danger">
  This is a **danger** callout. Use it for critical warnings about potential issues.
</Callout>

## Custom Titles

You can also provide custom titles:

<Callout variant="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  You can customize the title of any callout by passing a `title` prop.
</Callout>

## Collapsible Callouts

Callouts can be made collapsible:

<Callout variant="note" title="Click to expand" collapsible>
  This callout is collapsible! Click the header to toggle visibility.

  You can include any content here, including:
  - Lists
  - **Bold text**
  - `inline code`
</Callout>

## Code Blocks

Here's a TypeScript code example with syntax highlighting:

```typescript title="example.ts"
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function greetUser(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
}

const user: User = {
  id: "1",
  name: "Abijith",
  email: "hello@abijith.sh",
};

console.log(greetUser(user));
```

And here's a JavaScript example:

```javascript title="app.js"
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Hello, World!" });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

## Conclusion

MDX allows you to use React/Astro components directly in your Markdown content, making it much more powerful and flexible than plain Markdown.
