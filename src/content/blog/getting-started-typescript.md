TypeScript has become an essential tool for modern web development. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamentals of TypeScript and how it can improve your development workflow.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, helping catch errors during development rather than at runtime. This leads to more reliable code and better developer experience with enhanced IDE support.

## Basic Types

Let's start with the fundamental types:

```typescript
let name: string = "Abijith";
let age: number = 25;
let isActive: boolean = true;
```

## Interfaces

Interfaces define the structure of objects:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

## Conclusion

TypeScript's type system provides a solid foundation for building scalable applications. Start small and gradually adopt more advanced features as you become comfortable with the basics.
