This is my personal portfolio and blog website — a space where I showcase my projects, share my thoughts on software development, and document my learning journey.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a platform that I fully own and control. While LinkedIn and other platforms are great for networking, having my own website gives me complete freedom over how I present myself and my work. Plus, it was a great opportunity to learn Astro and modern static site generation.

## Features

- **Content Collections**: Type-safe content management using Astro's Content Collections with Zod validation
- **Fast Performance**: Static site generation with minimal JavaScript for optimal load times
- **Dark Mode**: Built-in theme toggle with system preference detection
- **Search**: Integrated FlexSearch for fast content search across posts and projects
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout the codebase

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Astro 5.x
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Content**: MDX for blog posts and projects
- **Search**: FlexSearch for client-side search
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6 via astro-icon
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions

## Design Philosophy

I believe in clean, minimal design that puts content first. This site follows the principles of simplicity, readability, and performance. The warm accent color and Satoshi font give it a distinctive yet professional look.

## What I Learned

Building this site taught me a lot about:

- Modern static site generation with Astro
- Content modeling and validation with Zod
- Implementing search functionality with FlexSearch
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- The importance of accessibility and semantic HTML
